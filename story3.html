<section id="rules">
    <h2>Rules of Football</h2>
    <p>Football is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective of the game is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Players are not allowed to use their hands or arms, except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area.</p>
    <p>Some key rules include offside, fouls, penalties, and throw-ins. Offside is when a player is in the opposing team's half of the field and closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent. Fouls are penalized by free kicks or penalties, depending on the severity and location of the offense.</p>
