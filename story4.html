    <p>
      Kabaddi is a contact team sport originating from ancient India, where two teams compete to score points by raiding into the opponent's 
      territory and tagging as many defenders as possible without being tackled. The game is played on a rectangular court with two halves 
      separated by a centerline. Each team takes turns sending a raider into the opponent's half, while the defenders attempt to stop the raider 
      and prevent them from returning to their own half.
      Points are scored when a raider successfully tags opponents and returns to their own half without being tackled. Defenders score points 
      by preventing the raider from returning or tackling them before they can tag opponents. Kabaddi requires speed, agility, and strength, 
      making it a thrilling and intense sport to watch and play.
